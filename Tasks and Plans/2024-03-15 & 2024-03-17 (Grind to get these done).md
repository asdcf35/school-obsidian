## Plans
2. Make questions or find questions that aim for the specific topic
3. Make questions or find questions that aim for a connection of a specific topic

**The Collect Stage** 
1. Make the note pages
	1. use the structure made in the pre study
2. take the notes
	1. If i know it write it
**The Clarify Stage**
1. use the notes to write a summary page
	1. this page is the Feynman Technique
2. create a diagram(can do this later)
	1. along with captions and explanation
**The Connect Stage**
1. Connect the 2 concepts and write a description
2. Create questions using any 2 concepts
**The Challenge Stage**
1. When coming back, solve those problems and put these into Anki
	1. Can't solve a problem =>
		1. Look at solution
		2. Understand the connections made(if there are)
		3. study the subject, while looking at the solution
		4. Feynman Technique again
			1. the concept
			2. how to use it to solve the problem
			3. how to solve the problem using the concept
## Log
- [x] Work on the Studies for Science Bowl
