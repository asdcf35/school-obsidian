## Actual Topic Study

- [I] This is where the notes for the topic go

* Magnification - how many times larger image is compared to real size of object
	* $\text{magnification} = \frac{\text{observed size of the image}}{\text{actual size}}$ or $M=\frac{I}{A}$
		* M = magnification
		* I = observed size of the image(the one you see)
		* A = actual size(the actual thing)

* resolution - ability to distinguish between 2 separate points
	* amount of detail that can be seen(clarity)
	* this is a limit on effective magnification
		* you won't see any more detail if you go past resolution
			* size of image happens after going past magnification
			* blurring after going past magnification

* unit of measurements
	* nanometers are used,  because they are that small
