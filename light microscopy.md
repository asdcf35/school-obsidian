* light
	* light travels in waves
		* waves have frequency & wavelengths
			* shorter wavelength = higher energy
	* electromagnetic spectrum - range of the different wavelengths light can emit
		* visible light falls between 400nm - 700nm
	* general rule is that limit of resolution 1/2 wavelength of the radiation used
		* smaller than 1/2 wavelength, you can't see it through the microscope
		* greatest resolution is 200nm
			* shortest wavelength of visible light is 400nm
			* max magnification = 1500x
		* there are things that are smaller
		* those are needed to be used



# Clarify section

Light microscopes are very useful. They were one of the first tools that were  used to look at cells. They work by essentially shining a light towards the eyepiece. Anything that can block the wavelength of the lights will be shown on the side. This works for opaque things, but not transparent things. Transparent things have to be dyed to be noticed by  the light microscopes. 
There are very important rules, and this is it's own sub-branch called cytology. 

But they run into a limit. See there are two key measurements with microscopes: magnification and resolution. Magnification is how much zoomed in the image is, while resolution is the distance between two things to know that they are separate. Here's an example: if I have a resolution of 20nm, this would mean that I need 20nm of distance between two things in order to see them separately. Magnification can only provide as detail as much as the resolution. If you zoom(increase the magnification) more than the resolution, then you will not see anymore clarity(what we really want when we are zooming in) and will lead to blurriness. 

The resolution is roughly equal to $\frac12$ the wavelength used to see the thing. The shortest wavelength a human can see is 400 nm(Violet light), and this corresponds to a maximum resolution of 200 nm. This is about 1500x the seeing power. While things like mitochondria might be seen, things like ribosomes are not easily seen.
