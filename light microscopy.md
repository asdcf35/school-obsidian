* microscopes rely on light.
* light
	* light travels in waves
		* waves have frequency & wavelengths
			* shorter wavelength = higher energy
	* electromagnetic spectrum - range of the different wavelengths light can emit
		* visible light falls between 400nm - 700nm
	* general rule is that limit of resolution 1/2 wavelength of the radiation used
		* smaller than 1/2 wavelength, you can't see it through the microscope
		* greatest resolution is 200nm
			* shortest wavelength of visible light is 400nm
			* max magnification = 1500x
		* there are things that are smaller
		* those are needed to be used



# Clarify section

Light microscopes are very useful. They were one of the first tools that were  used to look at cells. They work by essentially shining a light towards the eyepiece. Anything that can block the wavelength of the lights will be shown. It's basically a silhouette, but instead it allows for every
